##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure YOUR-PRODUCT-NAME

To install the YOUR-PRODUCT-NAME file on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, do the following:

1. Download the product file from Pivotal Network.

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under **Import a Product**, click **+** next to the version number of YOUR-PRODUCT-NAME.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly added **YOUR-PRODUCT-NAME** tile.

1. **This portion of the procedure should tell the users how to configure the newly added tile by
walking them through the sections. Which fields should they fill out? What are the different
checkboxes? Include relevant screenshots here.**

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply changes** to install YOUR-PRODUCT-NAME tile.

**If needed, include additional configuration information below. For example, maybe there are
configuration options not required for installation but which could be useful for certain users. Typical topics include:**
1. **Self-service**--Do you have recommendations on how to configure/design plans in the tile so that users can choose the best options for themselves?
1. **High availability**--How do you configure/deploy X Service tile to be highly available?
